# Changelog

All notable changes to agent-standard are documented here. Versions follow
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-01

Initial public release.

### Added

- **STANDARD.md** — the seven-part house standard: one source of truth (`AGENTS.md`
  canonical, `CLAUDE.md` as `@AGENTS.md` include), the `docs/solutions/` fix log,
  anti-drift `## Keep in sync` contracts, the self-healing SessionStart hook, commit
  authorship, default-to-main commit flow, and multi-account deploy hygiene.
- **bin/** — reusable, dependency-free bash workflow scripts: `repo-audit`,
  `secrets-audit`, `pr-risk`, `pr-approve`, `land-safely`, `crew`, `wt`,
  `repo-audit-notify`. Scan roots are configurable via `AGENT_STD_ROOTS`.
- **templates/** — a worked `docs/solutions/` fix-log entry with required frontmatter,
  the SessionStart self-healing hook, and a git pre-commit + gitignore starter.
- MIT license, README, CONTRIBUTING, and a code of conduct.
